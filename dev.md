## Shadcn-Svelte

[how to add a button](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/button)

Make sure you commit before adding a new component since there is no `uninstall`
command of `shadcn-svelte` CLI.

Configuration is at `components.json`, where you can find the defined location of
installed components.
